    Confluence
    \Program Files (x86)\XMBC\Addon\skin.confluence\720p\ViewsPVR.xml


Open the file in any text editor and search for the lines below. These lines are in the file twice so you will have to replace them both.
    For Confluence search for
    <texture border="3">epg-genres/$INFO[ListItem.Property(GenreType)].png</texture>


Change them to (Remember you need to replace the above twice)

    <texture border="3">epg-genres/$INFO[ListItem.Genre].png</texture>

Save the file once you have change both lines.


Second step need to add a epg-genres folder in the skins media folder 
    Confluence
    \Program Files (x86)\XMBC\Addon\skin.confluence\media


And add this file in the media folder (unzip and place epg-genres in the media folder)
There are two files. One has Transparent colors the other solid colors. Choose the one that best fits the skin you are using.

epg-genres.zip Transparent Colors

epg-genres.zip Solid Colors

In the epg-genres folder is the Genre color with Genre name.

In order for this to work you will have to restart XBMC. If you do any changes example: change color or add/change the genre name you will have to restart XBMC to show the changes in the EPG.

When you rename a file you can not use some special charaters example / Windows will not let you use this character or others but you can use dash. File names must match the genre name for the genre to change color. Example: Drama you will create Drama.png

This is a good fix till something better comes along. Maybe someone can make an addon. I'm trying to lean how to write an addon but I think there is not away to access the genre list from the XBMC code. If there is a way please PM me. There is not much detail on addon access to XBMC.

That is it. Enjoy your color EPG Genre.

Special Note about EPG Genre:
The EPG Data I am using is MediaPortal backend with Argus TV using XMLTV Schedule Direct. The XMLTV file you use might have different genre names so you will have to edit the color genre names to fit your XMLTV Genre. One thing you should know that some PVR addon handle genre different. Most XMLTV list shows more than one genre. Example the show “Castle” genre is ”Comedy Crime Drama Series”. Some clients only see the first Genre so Castle is “Comedy”. Some will show all 3 so then you will need to create a genre color name called “Comedy Crime Drama Series.png”. If you use MediaPortal backend with XMLTV plugin it will show all genres for a show. So looks like Argus TV only see the first one.
